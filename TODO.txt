Issues: 
	- Dialogs dissappear on orientation change. Might be a real bitch. Or a real meh. W/E
	- Some NPE or w/e when "Home"ing with dialog doing stuff. Pinpoint.
	- Open file on notification click, not ASE
	- Exotic file types unsupported on Android, works fine on PC
	- Check for local cache before downloading [check] Test dialog for other files/dialogs
	- Make Add folder button plus more visible

Tickets:
	- Center button layouts in dialogs
	- Select items
	- Copy and Cut (delete source files if cut, use boolean then delete method)
	- Delete (delete file or collection (Overloads))
	- Rename
	- Graphics, other layout nitpicking
	- Sort out license for MS example
	- Multi-file upload, folder upload

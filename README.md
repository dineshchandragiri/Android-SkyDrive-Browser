Android Explorer for SkyDrive
=============================

A cleaner, simpler Microsoft SkyDrive experience!

Using the Android Live SDK and ActionBarSherlock, Android Explorer for SkyDrive is a clean, free and ad-free client for SkyDrive.

Supports batch uploading and downloading, renaming, deleting, copying and moving.

Play audio, video and view images in-app and download everything else to open in a supported installed app with a click of the notification.

SkyDrive sharing functionality is also supported. Files shared with the user can be reached via a menu option, and sharing links for both read and read+write can be generated and shard through any supported app.
